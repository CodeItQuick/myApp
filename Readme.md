# Upon Review 5+ years later
I was interviewed for a webdev job 6 years ago. This was my submission at the time for a requested "count the words" task.

I blamed the interviewer/company for my failure for at least 4 years, until the day I revisited this codebase and checked the code.
Oh boy was I disappointed. The code is pretty terrible. After revisiting I wrote the solution (in javascript because who has time really)
to the problem presented. Might have taken me 30 minutes; I don't remember anymore. The first solution I spent an entire day on,
I doubt it even runs, and I honestly lack the courage to run the code I originally wrote.

# Original README
The program when run through visual studio will produce the desired output. The input is hardcoded in, but in the future an input may able to be taken. The other branch (development) is the start of such a program, but isn't finished.
